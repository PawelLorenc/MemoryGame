I spent the last four years in northern Canada working as an electrician. I had to work in various weather conditions - snow, rain, and the temperature would get as low as -40C in the winter. Sometimes I'd have to work long shifts, which required not seeing my family for 14 days or more. I complained to my brother about it - he's been a computer programmer for over 10 years now - and he asked if I would ever try programming. I was hesitant about it until I wrote my first code. Programming turned out to be nothing like I imagined it to be. It was fun, challenged me to think outside of the box, and to solve problems creatively. From then on, coding became my passion and I've rearranged my life in pursuit of a new career in programming. A couple of years ago, I retook my matura rozszerzona to get prerequisites to get into university and start a programming course. In September 2021, I moved back to Poland and began my program at Politechnika Krakowska. Everyday I am excited to learn more and to continue increasing my knowledge and skill. I'm chasing this goal not only for me, but for my wife and our baby to have a comfortable and stable life that we were never able to have in Canada.
